"""@package cpplib
@author Kasper Rantam√§ki
Module containing C++ implementations.

The module contains C++ code used to speedup computationally expensive operations. 
The C++ functions should be exported as dll or so objects and a Python wrapper created 
for them, which are then available from this module.
