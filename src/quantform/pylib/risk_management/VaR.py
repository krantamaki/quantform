    Default constructor that stores the given parameters as instance variables and does some basic
    calculations in preparation for calls to the instance. Note that it is recommended that the covariance matrix

    of approximating covariance see Chapter 23 in 'Options, Futures and Other Derivatives' (ninth edition)

                            be denoted in the same currency. The oldest values should be on row index 0 and newest
                            on row index -1.
