    """Constructor method
    
    Constructor method that calculates the implied volatilities for the options and initializes a CloughTocher2DInterpolator object based 
    on them. It is up to the user to make sure the value of the underlying and the report date used in calculating the 
    implied volatility are correct for the options market price. Additionally, if wanted runs a Gaussian filter on the datapoints 
    to smooth the data.
    
    Once the object is initialized it can be called with a tuple (<value of underlying>, <time from report date in years>).
    
    @param options                The options from which the implied volatility curve is interpolated. The options must
                                  have been initialized with the 'market_price' parameter.
    @param underlying_value       The value of the underlying at the time of option valuation
    @param report_date            The date for which the value of the underlying is quoted
    @param interp_range           The range over which volatilities are interpolated range used. Optional, defaults to None i.e. using all available options
    @param extrap_range           The range over which volatilities are inter- and extrapolated. Optional, defaults to None i.e. not extrapolating
    @param n_points               The number of uniformly distributed points in the strike range for which volatility is inter- and extrapolated. 
                                  Optional, defaults to 100
    @param apply_gaussian_filter  Boolean flag specifying if a Gaussian filter should be applied to the datapoints.
                                  Optional, defaults to False
    @param gaussian_filter_sd     The standard deviation for the Gaussian filter if applied. Optional, defaults to 2
    @raises AssertionError        Raised if the market price is not available for any of the options or if the options are
